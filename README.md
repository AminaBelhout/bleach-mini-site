# 🔥 Bleach-Themed Mini Website

Welcome to a fun little project I made for fellow Bleach fans!

This is NOT a full-blown app or serious training tool — it's just something I made for fun, with a bit of anime, tech, and vibes ✨

## 🌌 What’s Inside?

- A Bleach-inspired landing page with Soul Society flair
- A **Security+ Training Ground** (with a few light quiz questions)
- OST 3 vibes playing in the background 🎧
- A bit of Kenpachi-style motivation ⚔️

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## 🎯 Why?

I was bored, vibing to Bleach OST 3, and thought — why not mix anime with some tech stuff?  
So if you’re also a fan and want to kill a few minutes, check it out!
## 💬 Feedback?

Feel free to drop a suggestion, fork it, or just vibe with it.
